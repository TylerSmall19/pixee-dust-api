# Pixee Dust API
### Any Happy Little Thought

## What we do

This is the source code for the API back-end of the Pixee Dust iOS application. The app gives reminders throughout the day of topics a user is thankful for. This server is designed to be a public API to access all thoughts the application needs to run and keep its users happy.

For more details on the application, please check back later in development. Further instructions on the format of API requests, responses, and usage will be documented as the features launch. For now, the API is in its early stages with minimal features and aspirations to be deployed and supported soon.
